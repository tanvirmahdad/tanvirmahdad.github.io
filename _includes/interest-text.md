## **Authentication Security**  
In these works, we primarily analyze the security of state-of-the-art authentication systems and their vulnerabilities against well-designed attacks. The scope of these projects includes designing novel attack frameworks, evaluating the security of authentication systems using technical assessments and real-world user studies, and finally, securing these systems by mitigating the identified vulnerabilities with the help of modern AI/ML techniques.
