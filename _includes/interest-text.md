# **Authentication Security**  
In these works, we primarily analyze the security of state-of-the-art authentication systems and their vulnerabilities against well-designed attacks. The scope of these projects includes designing novel attack frameworks, evaluating the security of authentication systems using technical assessments and real-world user studies, and finally, securing these systems by mitigating the identified vulnerabilities with the help of modern AI/ML techniques.

### **FIDOLA**

This research examines the security of FIDO2 hardware security keys used in two-factor and passwordless authentication systems. We develop an attack framework called **FIDOLA (FIDO2 Deception Attack via Overlays exploiting Limited Display Authenticators)**, which injects hidden login sessions and deceives users into approving malicious requests through limited authenticator displays. 

Our analysis of FIDO2 protocols and OS-level security, combined with practical demonstrations, reveals a critical vulnerability not addressed in current specifications or prior research. A user study shows that **95.55% of participants** approved cross-service attacks when presented with deceptive overlays, highlighting a serious real-world threat to account security.
