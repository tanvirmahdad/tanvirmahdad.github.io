I completed my undergraduate from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology at Dhaka, Bangladesh

I am leading Secure, Trustworthy, User-Centric Systems and Digital Identity Lab (STUrDy Lab) at Ohio University. My research lies at the intersection of security, privacy, and ubiquitous computing, with a focus on:
Secure and privacy-preserving authentication systems, including multi-factor and passwordless methods [CCS' 24, MobiCom'23, WWW'25]
Speech privacy and side-channel attacks using smart devices, AR/VR platforms, and wearable devices [CCS'25, S&P'25, CCS'24, CCS'23, ICDCS'23]

Our work has received notable media coverage and recognition in the global security research community.
