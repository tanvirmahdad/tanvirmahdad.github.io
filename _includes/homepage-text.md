I am pursuing my Ph.D. at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} in college station, Texas, USA. I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Nitesh Saxena](https://nsaxena.engr.tamu.edu) at [SPIES Lab](https://spies.engr.tamu.edu). ​I began my Ph.D. studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the fall of 2019 and transferred to Texas A&M University in the fall of 2021. My research focuses on the security of authentication systems, including state-of-the-art multi-factor and passwordless authentication systems. Additionally, my recent work includes investigating speech privacy and side-channel attack using smart devices and wearables sensors.

I have already published my works at top-tier security and systems conferences and journals such as ACM Mobicom 2023, ACM CCS 2023, 2024, ACM TOPS, IEEE ICDCS 2023, ACM Mobisys 2023, ACM Wisec 2023, ICICS 2021. I also have 8 (eight) other works currently under review. I am expected to be graduated in Summer 2025.
