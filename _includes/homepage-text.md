</div>


I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} in college station, Texas, USA. I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Nitesh Saxena](https://nsaxena.engr.tamu.edu){:target="_blank"} at [SPIES Lab](https://spies.engr.tamu.edu){:target="_blank"}. I began my Ph.D. studies in the fall of 2019. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in Dhaka, Bangladesh.


My research focuses on the security of authentication systems, including state-of-the-art multi-factor and passwordless authentication systems. Additionally, my recent work includes investigating speech privacy and side-channel attacks using smart devices, AR/VR devices, and wearables sensors.

I have so far published 12 of my papers at top-tier security and systems conferences and journals such as <ins>**ACM CCS**</ins> (3 papers), <ins>**IEEE S&P**</ins>, <ins>**ACM MobiCom**</ins>, <ins>**ACM The Web Conference (WWW)**</ins>, <ins>**IEEE ICDCS**</ins> (2 papers), <ins>**ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security**</ins>. Our works have already got significant [media attention](https://tanvirmahdad.github.io/media/) within security communities worldwide. I also have 6 (six) other works currently under review. I am expected to graduate by Summer 2025.
