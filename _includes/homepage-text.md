 I am an Assistant Professor in the School of **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)** at **Ohio University**. Prior to joining Ohio University, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at **Texas A&M University** in the summer of 2025. I earned my undergraduate degree from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in Dhaka, Bangladesh.


I am leading Secure, Trustworthy, User-Centric Systems and Digital Identity Lab (**STUrDy Lab**) at Ohio University. My research lies at the intersection ofÂ security,Â privacy, andÂ ubiquitous computing, with a focus on:
- **Secure and privacy-preservingÂ authentication systems**, including multi-factor and passwordless methods [CCS' 24, MobiCom'23, WWW'25]
- **Speech privacyÂ andÂ side-channel attacksÂ using smart devices**, AR/VR platforms, and wearable devices [CCS'25, S&P'25, CCS'24, CCS'23, ICDCS'23]

Our work has received notable media coverage and recognition in the global security research community.
